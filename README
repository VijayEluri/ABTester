This is a project to provide a variant-selection
front end for web applications. The idea is that the app developer(s)
will be able to declare 'variants' of web pages or components,
have visitors steered into those variants, and have a way to measure
the effects of those variants as compared to the 'control' (non-varied)
versions.

[20101213] First commit, not yet really useful but I want to start
keeping it on github (and using that issue tracker, gists, etc). No license attached yet, plan to use GPLv3.
